# Quiki2

A revamp of the [Quiki](https://github.com/ambs/Quiki) tool.

After installing the module use the `quiki2` command line tool to create
a new wiki:

    $ quiki2 create myquiki

Your new wiki is a [Dancer](http://perldancer.org/) application. You
can run your new wiki:

    $ cd myquiki
    myquiki$ perl bin/app.pl

Or deploy it, as any other Dancer application.
